# Deep_Learning_Seq2Seq
Sequence to Sequence (often abbreviated to seq2seq) models is a special class of Recurrent Neural Network architectures that we typically use (but not restricted) to solve complex Language problems like Machine Translation, Question Answering, creating Chatbots, Text Summarization, etc.

Seq2Seq is a type of Encoder-Decoder model using RNN. It can be used as a model for machine interaction and machine translation.

By learning a large number of sequence pairs, this model generates one from the other.
